Player 2: tap left and right arrow keys to shift to the right and left of the battlefeild. Use numberkey7 to shoot and take out enemies

How to Play: Both players work to take down as many enemies as possible while also working to score as high as they can. 


Features: Some of the more intresting features that were added to the game were that the enemies have different behaviors that require the players to have to think and work a little harder when it comes to figureing out who they should shoot down next. Such as ememies with different movemtnt patterns and others that will have to take multiple hits in order to be destroyed.There was also the addition of a split scoring system so while the players are intended to work together, they can compete for the higest score against eachother as well.
