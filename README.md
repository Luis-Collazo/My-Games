Features: For this type of game I wanted it to be simple. I chose to use the 3d elements given in unity to build the background, player, projectile, and enemies. I chose Unity for the 3D elements instead of using something like Maya because originally I wanted to create a space invaders type game but when entering Maya for the first time in a while I got really overwhelmed and felt like if I had more time then I wouldâ€™ve been able to relearn the program and create the player and enemy models for that original idea that I had. But then I was given the idea to do a candy shooter by the playtesters and I decided to go forward with that. I chose the 3D Capsules to create the candy models for both the player and the enemies. Then using materials, I colored them all different colors representing different flavors of their respective candies. 
            For the background of the game, I used 3D objects to create something that resembles the inside of an empty candy box, and the end of the box is where the open flaps are. Another feature used was the shooting feature. I thought it would be cool to have a horde mode style game where every time you shoot you get points, so I added a shooting element to it and a score to keep track of the kills. Enemy spawns being random and quick is also something I implemented in order to make it feel like a traditional horde mode style game.
